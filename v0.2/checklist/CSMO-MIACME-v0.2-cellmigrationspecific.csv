An object that can exist independenty and can be identified uniquely.,An ontology concept that annotates the corresponding entity.,An attribute describing the corresponding entity.,An ontology concept that annotates the corresponding property.,The corresponding property should satisfy the specified condition (e.g. should be provided only if another property has a specific value).,"A statement of the exact meaning of the entity and/or property.
",The type of a property value.,The recommended resources (e.g. ontology or database) that should be used to assigned the values for the corresponding Entity/Property pair.,The expected number of occurrences for a particular property.,"Following RFC 2119 (http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt), a word indicating the level of necessity for a particular property.
","A reference to the document, article, schema, discussion that yields a particular entity or property necessary to be included and its requirement level.","Typical cases for the values of a particular property.
",Additional comments that may help the interpretation and representation of the corresponding entity and/or property.
