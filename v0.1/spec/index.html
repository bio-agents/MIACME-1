        MIACME is the Minimum Information About Cell Migration Experiments reporting guideline, which is being developed by the <a href="https://cmso.science/">Cell Migration Standardisation Organisation (CMSO)</a>.
        CMSO's goal is to facilitate the development of community standards for the field of cell migration and is supported by the <a href="http://multimot.org/">Multimot</a> project of
        <a href="http://cordis.europa.eu/project/rcn/193270_en.html">European Commission's H2020 programme</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        This document introduces MIACME v0.1 that is a checklist, or list of elements, for the minimal description of cell migration experiments with focus on in vitro experiments.The document and checklist are open for comments.
    </p>
    <p>
        MIACME will undergo a refinement process, through which it will be improved and extended, e.g. to include in vivo experiments. The CMSO will engage all the relevant stakeholders in the cell migration community in
        order to reach agreement on the minimal descriptors required to understand, interpret, evaluate, replicate and disseminate cell migration experiments. MIACME goal is to make the data produced in cell migration experiments
        FAIR (Findable Accessible Interoperable and Reusable) and to promote data access, data discovery, data preservation, maximise data re-use and repurpose through efficient annotation for long term archiving, and ultimately,
        enable reproducibility of cell migration experiments.

    <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

    <p>
        Reporting guidelines, or minimum information checklists, have been proposed as a way to understand the context, methods, data and conclusions of experiments in different domains [[Taylor2008]].
    </p>

    <p>
        These reporting guidelines for the life, environmental and biomedical sciences are maintained in the <a href="http://biosharing.org">BioSharing portal</a>. Their purpose and evolution have been considered in the development
        of MIACME, which is also registered in BioSharing. While many of the original reporting guidelines were simply a list of desired content information, many times available only in narrative form (e.g. in a PDF document),
        MIACME, whose <a href="https://biosharing.org/bsg-s000642">record</a> is also available in BioSharing, is taking a step further and formalising the requirements for reporting cell migration experiments.

    <h2 id="miacme">MIACME Reporting Guideline</h2>

    <p>
        MIACME comprises a checklist, or list of elements, for the minimal description of cell migration experiments. This release, version 0.1, focuses on in vitro experiments.
    </p>

    <p>
        The elements are presented as entities and properties, together with their definitions, their cardinality and requirement level, as well as recommended sources for their annotation, examples and notes.
        Defining this common set of metadata to guide researchers in reporting scientific context is important for data repositories, journals and funders in the cell migration domain.
    </p>

    <p>
        MIACME v0.1 was derived by considering discussions among participants in the working group and multiple sources, such as:
        <ul>
        <li>Discussions and notes from the <a href="https://cmso.science/meeting-2-3-march-2016/">CMSO Inaugural Workshop</a>, including:
            <ul>
                <li><a href="http://tiny.cc/miacme-ranking">Ranking of initial set of MIACME descriptors</a></li>
                <li><a href="http://tiny.cc/miacme-survey">MIACME Survey</a></li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><a href="http://genesis.ugent.be/uvpublicdata/cellmissy/cellmissySchema.xsd">CellMissy XML Schema</a></li>
        <li><a href="http://genesis.ugent.be/uvpublicdata/cellmissy/cellmissy_schema_1.0.4.sql">CellMissy Agent SQL schema</a></li>
        </ul>

</ul>

    </p>

    <p> MIACME v0.1 spreadsheet can be viewed here:
    <br>
    <iframe src="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1O-Mg2KbeWuU7Sx7hwyciXTAEA4WO1NwqzI-PnPuQDWc/pubhtml" frameborder="0" width="800px" height="600px"></iframe>
    <br>
    </p>

    <p>
        The spreadsheet contains the following information:

    <ul>
        <li>Entity: An object that can exist independently and can be identified uniquely.</li>
        <li>Entity Annotation: An ontology concept that annotates the corresponding entity.</li>
        <li>Property: An attribute describing the corresponding entity.</li>
        <li>Property Annotation:  An ontology concept that annotates the corresponding property.</li>
        <li>Condition on Property: The corresponding property should satisfy the specified condition (e.g. should be provided only if another property has a specific value).</li>
        <li>Definition: A statement of the exact meaning of the entity and/or property.</li>
        <li>Value Type: The type of a property value.</li>
        <li>Recommended resource: The recommended resources (e.g. ontology or database) that should be used to assign the values for the corresponding Entity/Property pair.</li>
        <li>Cardinality: The expected number of occurrences for a particular property.</li>
    <li>Requirement level: Following <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt">RFC 2119</a>, a word indicating the level of necessity for a particular property.</li>
        <li>Evidence: A reference to the document, article, schema, discussion that yields a particular entity or property necessary to be included and its requirement level.</li>
        <li>Example(s): Typical cases for the values of a particular property.</li>
        <li>Notes: Additional comments that may help the interpretation and representation of the corresponding entity and/or property.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
        The following figure provides an overview of MIACME entities, their relationships and cardinalities:

<section>
    <h4 id="roadmap">Future plans</h4>

    MIACME v0.1 has focused on identifying descriptors required to represent in vitro cell migration experiments. In the next steps, we will:
    <ul>
        <li>extend MIACME checklist to in vivo cell migration experiments</li>
        <li>produce examples of MIACME-compliant descriptions of different types of cell migration experiments</li>
        <li>include further requirements related to semantic artifacts and other external resources</li>
        <li>release new versions of the MIACME checklist after incorporating the feedback received</li>
    </ul>
